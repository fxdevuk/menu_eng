STARS
You want to keep your Stars front and centre, so make them very visible everywhere you can. This could be the dish you become known for and can be used in marketing. For example, "try our famous hot wings".

PLOW HORSES
Take a closer look at your Plow Horses. You want to make these more profitable. Can you sub out an ingredient or two for something similar, or more interesting? Can you ask your supplier for a new rate if you buy further in advance or commit to a certain amount per week or month? If your servers report food waste for this dish, can you reduce the portion size?

DOGS
It might be time to let the Dogs on your menu go. If they aren't popular or profitable, is there a solid reason for keeping them there? Is there a tweak you can make to increase the appeal of this menu item? Sometimes a recipe modification, new name and a revised description can make all the difference.

PUZZLES
Figure out the puzzle of why your Puzzles aren't popular. Here's where your qualitative research comes in handy. Perhaps it's priced a little too high, or it features a hate-it-or-love-it ingredient that can be substituted out. Could you include it in a meal deal to drive interest? Or give it a special spotlight on social media? It's worth spending the time to tweak and tailor this one until you get it right.
